# Mandelbrot JS

## What is it?

Mandelbrot JS is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">
Mandelbrot
</a>
fractal explorer. It use some progressive rendering
to be more interactive. This project is not as
polished as I would like but advanced enough so
I am comfortable to share it (see
limitations section).

## What for?

Mostly for fun, because exploring fractals can be
surprisingly full of surprises and amusment.

## But why?

Convinced that mathematics and arts are really
closer that it may looks, I wanted to craft
something far away from productivity, usefulness and
profitability. Mandelbrot was a perfect candidate as
sometimes complexity (beauty) appears out of nowhere
behind simple things like a simple mathematical
formula. Along the way this project was a good way
to challenge my programming skills.

address most of those limitations but I have no
concrete plans to address them except when I feel
like it :)
